# Singapore Light-Emitting Diode Lighting Module Market Size, Growth - Latest Insights Published

<strong>Light-Emitting Diode Lighting Module Market Snapshot 2025-2033 provides a concise overview of market trends, forecasts, and growth opportunities over the forecast period:</strong>

A light-emitting diode (LED) is a two-lead semiconductor light source. It is a pn junction diode that emits light when activated. When a suitable current is applied to the leads, electrons are able to recombine with electron holes within the device, releasing energy in the form of photons. This effect is called electroluminescence, and the colour of the light (corresponding to the energy of the photon) is determined by the energy band gap of the semiconductor. LEDs are typically small (less than 1 mm2) and integrated optical components may be used to shape the radiation pattern.
